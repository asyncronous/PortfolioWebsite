                <h2>Rational Magic Systems</h2>
                <h3>17th June 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    Rational Magic systems are magic systems that make a certain kind of sense. They have rules that canâ€™t be broken, or there are rules for when the rules can be broken! Where the magic comes from, and what can be done with it has to be constrained, it canâ€™t be used to solve problems in the plot at the drop of a hat. Iâ€™ve been using this idea to develop a system of magic that fits into a kind of science-fantasy setting, artificial intelligence aided nanomachine stuff, but with wizards! Itâ€™s all very silly to be honest but itâ€™s a great way to waste time.

                <h2>Fantasy World Building</h2>
                <h3>5th June 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    I recently started listening to the Mistborn series of books on Audible, and it gave me a new idea for a book that I was trying to write years ago so I thought Iâ€™d give it another go. Iâ€™ve since gone into the weeds with how the magic and politics of my fictitious world would operate and itâ€™s probably stifled any attempts at prose because I need everything to be worked out before I start writing! Regardless, the process of building a fantasy world in your mind and putting your ideas on paper is a great way to spend your free time if youâ€™ve been doing too much coding!

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <h3>20th May 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve always been creatively minded, I loved doing origami as a kid and enjoyed sketching, but until my trip to Europe Iâ€™d never delved into Photography, but Iâ€™m super glad I did.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Just before my trip I went and bought a fairly cheap digital Canon, and over the course of the trip I took hundreds of photos, most of them terrible. But surprisingly some of them came out fairly well, and while Iâ€™ll never pretend Iâ€™m a great photographer I do seem to have a good sense of framing; getting things in the right spot. Thatâ€™s what the photography teacher I found in Leiden told me anyway!

                <h2>Game Dev in Unity</h2>
                <h3>15th Apr 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    It was about October 2018 that I decided to try my hand at <a href="gamedev.html">game development</a>, and downloaded Unity. Iâ€™d read a few times that game developers are born when a gamer wants to play a game that doesnâ€™t exist yet, and so it went for me.         
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The game is intended to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a>, a procedurally generated world thatâ€™s different every time, permadeath so when you die you have to start over in a new world, etc; but real-time instead of turn-based, and not on a grid. It will not be dissimilar to the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/506870/Unexplored/">Unexplored</a> but will play more like a real-time tactics game. Iâ€™ve developed a few cool things on the journey, both a dungeon generator and a biome generator, which generates cave systems with rooms and puzzles, and open areas with trees/lakes/rives/caves respectively. Iâ€™ve made my own procedural animation system because I couldnâ€™t get my head around Unityâ€™s Mechanim system. I made a procedural mesh generator for the objects in the world that donâ€™t need to be prefabbed. Iâ€™ve also made my own modular a* pathfinding system for the AI so that I could easily give them different behaviours in how they manoeuvre toward and around the player. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Alas, while all this sounds great, the project is currently broken as I messed up transferring the project files from my old windows 7 system to a new windows 10 one, so I have a bit of work to do to get back to where I am in the most recent video on <a href="gamedev.html">this page</a>. But I still have all my old scripts so it shouldnâ€™t take me too long to put everything back together and press on.

                <h2>Europe Trip</h2>
                <h3>23rd Feb 2020</h3>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™ve talked a lot to friends, family and just about everyone whoâ€™ll listen about my little solo trip to Europe but I havenâ€™t actually written anything down. I kinda regret that, would have been cool to look back on a written journal containing my thoughts at the time, and while I did take hundreds of photos chronicling the trip, many of which you can see on my <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> page, itâ€™s not quite the same. So I thought Iâ€™d start with a short summary of the trip, and in future posts go into each part of the trip in detail, not an exhaustive amount, but the right amount to stretch my writing muscles.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    First things first, this was the order of countries and places I went to:

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In later blog posts Iâ€™ll go into more detail about each leg of the trip!</p>
